ABOUT THIS MODULE
This module is developed to integrate WalkMe with Drupal 8. This module add the Walkme snippet in the head tag of each page.

How do I Test that the WalkMe Snippet is Working?
To test the snippet to make sure it's set up correctly:
    1. Open your site.
    2. Right-click and select inspect the page.
    3. Open the console.
    4. Enter the following text query: _walkMe.getEnvId();
       If it returns undefined, the Snippet is not properly set up. If the query returns a value, then you're all set!
